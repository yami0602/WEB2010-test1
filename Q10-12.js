// IMPORTANT: Make sure you test every answer in the console to make sure it
// prints what you want it to.

// Question 10
// Create a new type of Object called *Athlete* with the following properties:
//
// 1. name
// 2. age
// 3. sex
// 4. height
// 5. weight
// 6. the last five marks reached in competitions (as an array named marks).
//
// IMPORTANT: you must use pseudoclassical notation

let Athlete = {
    name: 'Yamile Sagales',
    age: 20,
    sex: "Female",
    height: "5'4",
    weight: 115,
    marks:[1,2,3,4,5]
   
}
console.log(Athlete)







// Question 11
// Create a prototypal function on the Athlete prototype named getMarksAverage
// which computes the average of the marks of the athlete.










// Question 12
// Create a prototypal function on the Athlete prototype called getRoundedMarks
// which uses the Array.map function and Math.round in order to round the marks
// of the athlete to the nearest integer. Your function should return an array
// with the rounded marks.
